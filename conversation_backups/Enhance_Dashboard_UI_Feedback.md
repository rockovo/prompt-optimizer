## USER Objective:
Enhance Dashboard UI Feedback
The user's primary goal is to enhance the dashboard UI of their browser extension by implementing visual feedback mechanisms and improving user interaction. This involves:
1.  **Implementing red/green badge indicators** on tab labels to show the completion status of questions within each category (red for unanswered, green for all answered), updating in real-time.
2.  **Styling tab labels** to include a colored category badge that visually matches the badges used in the question accordion headers.
3.  **Restoring and enhancing clickable examples** within question cards, where example text is parsed into individual clickable options that, when selected, paste into the answer box.
4.  **Implementing regeneration validation** to prevent regeneration if no questions have been answered and to provide a confirmation popup with a list of unanswered questions (grouped by category) if regeneration is attempted with partial answers.
