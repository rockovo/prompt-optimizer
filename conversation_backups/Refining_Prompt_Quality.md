## USER Objective:
Refining Prompt Quality

The user's main objective is to enhance the Prompt Optimizer extension by implementing an iterative prompt refinement workflow. This involves adding a quality score (1-10) with color-coded indicators and enabling the extension to automatically update the prompt text with improved versions based on user answers. The goal is to transform the extension into a tool that guides users towards higher quality prompts through continuous feedback and AI-driven suggestions.
