## USER Objective:
Enhance Prompt Suggestions

The user's main objective is to fix the issue where the original prompt text area is not updated with the improvedPrompt after analysis, even though the quality score increases. Additionally, the user wants to implement a new feature where if they answer a clarifying question with uncertainty (e.g., "I don't know", "not sure", or asking a clarifying question back), the system should provide a maximum of 3 detailed suggestions per question, indicating a recommended option. This involves updating the UI to display these suggestions and ensuring the underlying logic in ackground.js correctly generates them.
