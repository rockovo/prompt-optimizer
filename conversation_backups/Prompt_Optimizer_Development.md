## USER Objective:
Prompt Optimizer Development
The user's main objective is to develop a prompt optimizer extension. This involves designing a system prompt for Haiku 4.5 to analyze user prompts for ambiguities and potential issues, generate clarifying questions with explanations, and return them in a structured format. Concurrently, the user needs to build the UI flow using vanilla JavaScript and CSS, allowing users to input prompts, view suggestions, answer questions inline, and regenerate analyses based on their answers.
